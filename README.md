# Fiery Whip of BALROG

_BALROG's fiery whip, which he used to pull Gandalf off the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. So the whip sort of improves BALROG's capabilities...__

Exploring effective area corrections of Fermi/GBM NaI detectors using BALROG (![Burgess et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2853), ![Berlato et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0413)) and ![Morogth](https://github.com/grburgess/morgoth), the master of Balrog.
For modelling and fitting ![threeML](https://github.com/threeML/threeML) and ![astromodels](https://github.com/threeML/astromodels) are used.

__Goal:__ Accounting for different detection efficiencies of the NaI detectors, which area most likely the cause of systematic uncertainty on BALROG's current localizations.
